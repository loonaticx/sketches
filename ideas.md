# Ideas

Hi there. If you are not Loonatic and stumbled upon this file, it'd probably be best to just look away; trust me, this file isn't that interesting. It's just a brain dump that I'm writing out loud.

- Is it possible to recreate the tool that Disney used to separate the different layers (model+vertex color only as one layer, actual texture on another.)


- epic demo toggling stuff like toggleShowVertices, toggleBackface, ....

- maybe make scripts for certain demos like texture / uv clamping
    - texture card p3d api
    - bam flattening

- maybe MAYBE figure out 3d texture/overlay stuff

- possible procedual rendering w/ whatever like shirts with
```
        base.graphicsEngine.renderFrame()
        base.win.saveScreenshot("1.png")
```

script to allow multiple models to be loaded in, use keys to alternate between the different models (intended to see any node differences between two identical-looking models
ex: ttc_original, ttc_mod_v1, ttc_mod_v2
allow for typical render.analyze, but also have the ability to show hidden nodes & what directions they are facing

pstats stuff, eventually.
