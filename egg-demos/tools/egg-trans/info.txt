egg-trans reads an egg file and writes an essentially equivalent egg
file to the standard output, or to the file specified with -o.  Some
simple operations on the egg file are supported.

Usage:
  egg-trans [opts] -o output.egg input.egg
  egg-trans [opts] input.egg >output.egg

Options:
  -noabs       Don't allow the input egg file to have absolute
               pathnames.  If it does, abort with an error.  This option
               is designed to help detect errors when populating or
               building a standalone model tree, which should be
               self-contained and include only relative pathnames.

  -F           Flatten out transforms.

  -t           Apply texture matrices to UV's.

  -T           Collapse equivalent texture references.

  -c           Clean out degenerate polygons and unused vertices.

  -C           Clean out higher-order polygons by subdividing into
               triangles.

  -mesh        Mesh triangles into triangle strips.  This is mainly
               useful as a tool to visualize the work that the mesher
               will do, since triangles are automatically meshed
               whenever an egg file is loaded.  Note that, unlike the
               automatic meshing at load time, you are must ensure that
               you do not start out with multiple triangles with
               different attributes (e.g. texture) together in the same
               group.

  -N           Standardize and uniquify group names.

  -pr path_replace
               Sometimes references to other files (textures, external
               references) are stored with a full path that is
               appropriate for some other system, but does not exist
               here.  This option may be used to specify how those
               invalid paths map to correct paths.  Generally, this is
               of the form 'orig_prefix=replacement_prefix', which
               indicates a particular initial sequence of characters
               that should be replaced with a new sequence; e.g.
               '/c/home/models=/beta/fish'.  If the replacement prefix
               does not begin with a slash, the file will then be
               searched for along the search path specified by -pp.  You
               may use standard filename matching characters ('*', '?',
               etc.) in the original prefix, and '**' as a component by
               itself stands for any number of components.

               This option may be repeated as necessary; each file will
               be tried against each specified method, in the order in
               which they appear in the command line, until the file is
               found.  If the file is not found, the last matching
               prefix is used anyway.

  -pp dirname  Adds the indicated directory name to the list of
               directories to search for filenames referenced by the
               source file.  This is used only for relative paths, or
               for paths that are made relative by a -pr replacement
               string that doesn't begin with a leading slash.  The
               model-path is always implicitly searched anyway.

  -ps path_store
               Specifies the way an externally referenced file is to be
               represented in the resulting output file.  This assumes
               the named filename actually exists; see -pr to indicate
               how to deal with external references that have bad
               pathnames.  This option will not help you to find a
               missing file, but simply controls how filenames are
               represented in the output.

               The option may be one of: rel, abs, rel_abs, strip, or
               keep.  If either rel or rel_abs is specified, the files
               are made relative to the directory specified by -pd.  The
               default is rel.

  -pd path_directory
               Specifies the name of a directory to make paths relative
               to, if '-ps rel' or '-ps rel_abs' is specified.  If this
               is omitted, the directory name is taken from the name of
               the output file.

  -pc target_directory
               Copies textures and other dependent files into the
               indicated directory.  If a relative pathname is
               specified, it is relative to the directory specified with
               -pd, above.

  -td dirname  Copy textures to the indicated directory.  The copy is
               performed only if the destination file does not exist or
               is older than the source file.

  -te ext      Rename textures to have the indicated extension.  This
               also automatically copies them to the new filename
               (possibly in a different directory if -td is also
               specified), and may implicitly convert to a different
               image format according to the extension.

  -tt type     Explicitly specifies the image format to convert textures
               to when copying them via -td or -te.  Normally, this is
               unnecessary as the image format can be determined by the
               extension, but sometimes the extension is insufficient to
               unambiguously specify an image type.

  -delod dist  Eliminate LOD's by choosing the level that would be
               appropriate for a camera at the indicated fixed distance
               from each LOD.  Use -delod -1 to keep all the LOD's as
               they are, which is the default.

  -no          Strip all normals.

  -np          Strip existing normals and redefine polygon normals.

  -nv threshold
               Strip existing normals and redefine vertex normals.
               Consider an edge between adjacent polygons to be smooth
               if the angle between them is less than threshold degrees.

  -nn          Preserve normals exactly as they are.  This is the
               default.

  -tbn name    Compute tangent and binormal for the named texture
               coordinate set(s).  The name may include wildcard
               characters such as * and ?.  The normal must already
               exist or have been computed via one of the above options.
               The tangent and binormal are used to implement bump
               mapping and related texture-based lighting effects.  This
               option may be repeated as necessary to name multiple
               texture coordinate sets.

  -tbnall      Compute tangent and binormal for all texture coordinate
               sets.  This is equivalent to -tbn "*".

  -tbnauto     Compute tangent and binormal for all normal maps.

  -TS sx[,sy,sz]
               Scale the model uniformly by the given factor (if only
               one number is given) or in each axis by sx, sy, sz (if
               three numbers are given).

  -TR x,y,z    Rotate the model x degrees about the x axis, then y
               degrees about the y axis, and then z degrees about the z
               axis.

  -TA angle,x,y,z
               Rotate the model angle degrees counterclockwise about the
               given axis.

  -TT x,y,z    Translate the model by the indicated amount.

               All transformation options (-TS, -TR, -TA, -TT) are
               cumulative and are applied in the order they are
               encountered on the command line.

  -o filename  Specify the filename to which the resulting egg file will
               be written.  If this option is omitted, the egg file is
               written to standard output.

  -cs coordinate-system
               Specify the coordinate system of the resulting egg file.
               This may be one of 'y-up', 'z-up', 'y-up-left', or
               'z-up-left'.  The default is the same coordinate system
               as the input egg file.  If this is different from the
               input egg file, a conversion will be performed.

  -f           Force complete loading: load up the egg file along with
               all of its external references.

  -h           Display this help page.
