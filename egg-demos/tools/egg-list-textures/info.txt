egg-list-textures reads an egg file and writes a list of the textures it
references.  It is particularly useful for building up the textures.txa
file used for egg-palettize, since the output format is crafted to be
compatible with that file's input format.

Usage:
  egg-list-textures [opts] input.egg

Options:
  -noabs       Don't allow the input egg file to have absolute
               pathnames.  If it does, abort with an error.  This option
               is designed to help detect errors when populating or
               building a standalone model tree, which should be
               self-contained and include only relative pathnames.

  -cs coordinate-system
               Specify the coordinate system to operate in.  This may be
               one of 'y-up', 'z-up', 'y-up-left', or 'z-up-left'.  The
               default is the coordinate system of the input egg file.

  -f           Force complete loading: load up the egg file along with
               all of its external references.

  -h           Display this help page.
