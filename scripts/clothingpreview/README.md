# Clothing Render / Previewer

## Usage
You can load in shirt, sleeve, and short textures (skirt wip) and take transparent render screenshots
to use for graphic design/promotional purposes.

If you actually use this script, it might yell at you for missing textures. They don't really matter much.

## Controls

s = Take screenshot
o = toggle oobe/free camera
r = reload loaded textures
1 = toggle shirt
2 = toggle bottoms
mouse wheel up = zoom in
mouse wheel down = zoom out
mouse3 = reset zoom
left arrow = rotate negative heading
right arrow = rotate positive heading
up arrow = rotate positive pitch
down arrow = rotate negative pitch

## Todo

Torso only frame (better),
Bottom only frame too (better),
m and f body types (specifically skirts),
different body types (fat, skinny)
Add onscreen text that displays the offset (camers zoom, clothing rotation, etc.) <-- will be hidden in screenshots
