# GLSL Shaders Demo

This folder is very messy & all over the place right now. I don't really know what I am doing for the most part when it comes to shaders, so everything is still a scientist experiment for me.

# Credits
I pretty much yoinked drewcification's shaders he made for Toontown Offline.

I also yoinked some of Cog Invasion Online's shaders from their resources repository.

ll the shaders used here are in the public domain, no leaking here.
