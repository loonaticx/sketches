# Loonatic's Sketchbook Repository

## What's this?

This repository is a personal collection of random scripts, demos, and other things I've made to help assist me in various Panda3D/Toontown tasks. It's also my public sandbox repo for experimenting around with Panda.

I use this repository to study Panda3D and currently computer graphics techniques. That being said, I try to create write-ups and demos for some of the various tools provided here. If you find use for any of these tools, feel free to use them. *They're public for a reason.* Ultimately, I am further researching ways to optimize the most out of rendering scenes & models.

I aim to publish & migrate these write-ups to my [personal website](https://loonatic.pro/tutorials) eventually.
